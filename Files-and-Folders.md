    *(Unpublished blog posts.)*  
    Posts placed here can be previewed locally but won't appear on the live site until moved to `_posts/`.

- **_includes/**  
    Contains partial HTML files (e.g., `analytics.html`) that can be reused across layouts using `{% include %}`.

- **_layouts/**  
    Contains page templates (e.g., `default.html`) that define how different pages look structurally.

- **_posts/**  
    Contains published blog posts.  
    The filenames follow the `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` format for date-based post management.

- **_sass/**  
    Contains `.scss` files (Sass stylesheets) for modular CSS styling.  
    Likely used with `style.scss` for overall styling.

- **papers/**  
    A custom directory for academic papers or PDFs.
