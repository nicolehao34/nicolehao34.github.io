Presented InkSight AI, an AI-driven accessible note-taking platform for STEM students with disabilities, at the 2024 Cornell Tech Entrepreneurship Showcase. The presentation highlighted how InkSight uses AI to improve lecture accessibility for blind/low-vision, hard-of-hearing, and neurodivergent learners; market opportunities, and more. I also connected with investors and industry executives at the event for fundraising.
