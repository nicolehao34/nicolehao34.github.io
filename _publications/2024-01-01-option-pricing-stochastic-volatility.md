This research implemented finite difference schemes (Forward Euler, Backward Euler, and Crank-Nicolson) in MATLAB to approximate solutions for European and up-and-out barrier options, conducting convergence and stability analyses across numerical methods. The work was selected for presentation at the 2023 Young Mathematicians Conference and the 2024 Joint Mathematics Meetings.
