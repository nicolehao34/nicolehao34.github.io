# Study Notes on Cognitive Science

## 1. Introduction
- What is cognitive science?
- Interdisciplinary nature: psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, philosophy, computer science, anthropology.
- Major questions: How does the mind represent, process, and use information?

## 2. Foundations of Cognition
- Information processing approach
- Symbolic vs. connectionist models
- Embodied and situated cognition

## 3. Perception
- Visual, auditory, tactile perception
- Gestalt principles
- Perception-action coupling

## 4. Attention
- Selective vs. divided attention
- Theories of attention (filter, spotlight, resource models)
- Neural mechanisms of attention

## 5. Memory
- Types: sensory, short-term/working memory, long-term memory
- Encoding, storage, retrieval
- Models: Atkinson-Shiffrin, Baddeley’s working memory model
- Neural correlates of memory

## 6. Language
- Structure: phonology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics
- Theories of language acquisition (Chomsky vs. connectionist)
- Neurolinguistics: Broca’s & Wernicke’s areas

## 7. Learning & Development
- Classical and operant conditioning
- Cognitive development (Piaget, Vygotsky)
- Implicit vs. explicit learning

## 8. Reasoning & Decision-Making
- Deductive vs. inductive reasoning
- Heuristics and biases (Tversky & Kahneman)
- Rationality, bounded rationality
- Dual-process theories (System 1 vs. System 2)

## 9. Consciousness
- Theories of consciousness (global workspace, integrated information)
- Qualia and subjective experience
- Neural correlates of consciousness

## 10. Cognitive Science & Artificial Intelligence
- **AI inspired by cognition:**
  - Symbolic AI (rule-based systems, expert systems)
  - Connectionist AI (neural networks inspired by brain processes)
  - Cognitive architectures (SOAR, ACT-R)
- **Cognitive models in AI:**
  - Natural language processing (linguistics + computation)
  - Vision systems (perception-inspired mod
