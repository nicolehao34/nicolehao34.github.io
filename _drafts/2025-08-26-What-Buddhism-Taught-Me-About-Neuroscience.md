# Your Brain is a Prediction Model

The core function of the brain is building a prediction model of the world's causal order based on past experiences. It iterates and makes real-time predictions, and modifies the model based on the differences between prediction and experience. This framework, known as the Bayesian brain theory, suggests that perception, decision-making, and even action are driven by probabilistic inference: 

**The brain combines prior beliefs with incoming sensory evidence to form the most likely explanation of the world.**

In other words, we donâ€™t passively receive reality, we actively construct it through a cycle of prediction and error correction.
