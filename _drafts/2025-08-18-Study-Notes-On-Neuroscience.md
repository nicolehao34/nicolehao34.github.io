# Study Notes on Neuroscience

## 1. Introduction
- What is neuroscience?
- Major questions and scope (molecular → cognitive).

## 2. Nervous System Overview
- Central Nervous System (CNS)
- Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)
- Basic cell types: neurons vs. glia

## 3. Neuron Structure & Function
- Parts of a neuron: dendrites, soma, axon, synapse
- Action potentials & signal transmission
- Neurotransmitters & receptors

## 4. Brain Anatomy
- Major brain regions (cortex, cerebellum, brainstem, limbic system)
- Functional areas (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital lobes)

## 5. Sensory & Motor Systems
- Vision, hearing, touch, taste, smell
- Motor pathways & control

## 6. Higher Cognitive Functions
- Memory and learning
- Language
- Attention and consciousness
- Emotion and motivation

## 7. Methods in Neuroscience
- Imaging (fMRI, PET, EEG, MEG)
- Electrophysiology
- Lesion studies
- Computational models

## 8. Disorders of the Nervous System
- Neurological (e.g., epilepsy, stroke, Parkinson’s)
- Psychiatric (e.g., depression, schizophrenia)
- Developmental (e.g., autism, ADHD)

## 9. Neuroscience & Artificial Intelligence
- **Inspiration from Neuroscience:**
  - Neurons → artificial neural networks  
  - Hebbian learning → learning rules in AI  
  - Visual cortex → convolutional neural networks (CNNs)  
- **Feedback from AI to Neuroscience:**
  - Deep learning models as brain models (e.g., vision, language)  
  - Tools for analyzing neural data (pattern recognition, decoding brain signals)  
- **Shared Challenges:**
  - Representation and abstraction of information  
  - Understanding learning, memory, and generalization  
- **Frontiers:**
  - Brain-inspired computing (neuromorphic chips)  
  - Cognitive architectures & large language models  
  - Ethical considerations of human-AI parallels  

## 10. Applications & Future Directions
- Neurotechnology (BCI, neuroprosthetics)
- AI and computational neuroscience
- Neuroethics
