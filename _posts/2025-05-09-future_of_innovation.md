title: The Future of Innovation & The End of Academic Monopoly
---

In today’s landscape, companies—not universities—are becoming the core engines of innovation.

# The Internet Has Democratized Knowledge 

Let's face it: **the rise of the internet has completely democratized access to knowledge.**

Academia’s monopoly on expertise is no longer as effective. Information is cheap and everywhere. Anyone with drive and curiosity can learn anything online. A 2023 report from the National Student Clearinghouse found that computer science and engineering enrollments in U.S. universities have plateaued, while coding bootcamps and industry certifications (e.g., Google or AWS) have seen explosive growth ([National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, 2023](https://nscresearchcenter.org)). This suggests that many aspiring technologists are bypassing universities altogether.  

If you’re a self-directed learner, the internet can turn you into an expert in almost any field. That means when it comes to theoretical knowledge, academia doesn't hold the same edge it once did. 

This isn’t to discredit the work of academics or higher education institutions. After all, universities still produce groundbreaking research, create an environment for deep intellectual collaboration, and provide structured learning and mentorship for those who thrive in that environment. Universities remain vital for foundational science and critical thinking, but when it comes to moving ideas from the lab to the market, the private sector is pulling ahead...

# The Shift to Applied Innovation

**Hot take #2: We might be reaching the limits of traditional theoretical science.**

A 2021 analysis in *Nature* found that scientific papers and patents are becoming increasingly incremental rather than revolutionary ([Park et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06106-4)). The low-hanging fruit of 20th-century science (semiconductors, antibiotics, nuclear energy) has been picked. As a result, harder, niche problems that require industry collaboration. 

There just aren’t many paradigm-shifting breakthroughs left that can radically transform manufacturing or other industries. The real innovation today is happening on the ground—solving hard, practical engineering problems. And that’s where startup teams and industry engineers, who are in the trenches, have a major advantage over academics. Companies like Apple, NVIDIA, and Moderna now invest more in R&D than many governments. In 2023, Amazon spent **$73 billion** on R&D—more than France’s entire public research budget ([Statista, 2023](https://statista.com); [OECD, 2023](https://oecd.org)). Many transformative technologies, like OpenAI’s GPT models and Tesla’s autonomous driving systems, were developed in industry. A 2022 Stanford study found that **80% of AI breakthroughs** originate in corporate labs ([Zhang et al., 2022](https://aiindex.stanford.edu)). Meanwhile, university research struggles with funding gaps and slow tech transfer processes ([Britt, 2023](https://sciencebusiness.net)).  
 
This might be more of a dire issue, especially in the U.S., under the current political climate.

# VC Demands Execution. Not Just Ideas.

**Hot take (maybe not really a hot take) #3: An idea or a patent from an academic project will no longer be sufficient as the driving force behind a successful startup.**

The shift to applied innovation, coupled with tightening U.S. funding landscapes, explains why academic projects struggle to attract investment. I define early-stage academic projects this way: These projects are research endeavors in their initial phases of exploration, where the focus is on hypothesis testing, foundational discovery, or proof-of-concept development. These projects are characterized by high uncertainty, minimal preliminary data, and no immediate path to commercialization. 

A good, maybe even **exceptional** example of an academic project that succeeded in securing funding from VCs would be **Moderna**. 

Moderna’s core technology—messenger RNA (mRNA)—originated in academic research at institutions like MIT, Harvard, and the University of Pennsylvania. Initial academic work for Moderna's core innovation relied on grants from agencies like the NIH. However, funding stagnation in the 2000s–2010s limited progress. For example, [Karikó](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katalin_Karik%C3%B3)’s grant applications were repeatedly rejected, forcing her to pursue smaller, niche funding sources. Despite these circumstances, Moderna's pivot to applied innovation, developing mRNA as a therapeutic platform, and efforts in raising funding from the 2000s to the 2010s, allowed it to secure [**4.9 billion in venture capital** support by 2015](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2022/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2021-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx) and later dominate the COVID-19 vaccine market, generating [**18.5 billion** in 2021](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2021/U.S.-Government-Purchases-Additional-200-Million-Doses-of-Modernas-COVID-19-Vaccine/default.aspx).

However, this is a success that's **harder to replicate in 2025**.

Federal agencies now favor "use-inspired" research aligned with immediate societal needs (e.g., AI, pandemic preparedness), [leaving curiosity-driven, academic projects underfunded](https://sparkthefiregrantwriting.com/blog/2025-overview-of-the-scientific-grant-writing-landscape). Only **33%** of university research funding is projected to come from federal sources by 2025, down from **60%** in 2000. 

Additionally, the shift to commercialization-driven endeavors in R&D investment is real. According to a 2025 academic research and development global market report, private R&D investment now constitutes **73%** of total U.S. R&D spending, but businesses focus overwhelmingly on [applied research (55%) and experimental development (87%)](https://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/academic-research-and-development-global-market-report). These are all areas closer to commercialization. For instance, [cleantech investors favor energy storage or EVs over speculative academic research in renewable energy](https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/eur/en/insights/markets-and-investing/ideas-and-insights/alternative-investments-in-2025-our-top-five-themes-to-watch). VCs and private equity increasingly target ventures with clear market pathways (e.g., AI software, healthcare spinouts), this, again, [creates a disadvantage for early-stage academic projects underfunded]([https://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/academic-research-and-development-global-market-report](https://www.iqvia.com/insights/the-iqvia-institute/reports-and-publications/reports/global-trends-in-r-and-d-2025)). A lot of seasoned VCs aren’t even touching angel or Series A rounds anymore. 

**The bar is simply higher.** 

Founders are expected to get scrappy, find early traction, and get through the A round before serious capital even considers coming in. Investors want to see a clearer picture before they write a check. Data from PitchBook (2024) shows that seed-stage funding has grown, but Series A rounds have become far more selective ([PitchBook-NVCA Venture Monitor, 2024](https://pitchbook.com)).  Investors now expect startups to demonstrate revenue, customer adoption, or a clear path to monetization before committing. Someone with a more academically trained background, like a full-time PhD student, might be constrained by their responsibilities in education and struggle with contributing time to their startup endeavors.

This doesn’t mean PhDs or academically trained founders are less likely to get funded, but it’s no longer a strong differentiator in most sectors these days. An analysis of 347 U.S. unicorns over the past decade shows that just 18% had at least one PhD founder. Their performance is only slightly better (but not significantly so) than non-PhDs in terms of valuation efficiency and time to $1B. However, in technical sectors like [healthcare (44.1%) and AI/ML or big data (31.4%)](https://medium.com/foothill-ventures/are-phds-a-good-bet-as-founders-25fe341c47b2), PhDs are notably overrepresented and tend to build more efficient, high-performing companies. Still, a PhD and a patent alone no longer guarantee a competitive edge in the eyes of modern VCs.

# A Question Only You Can Answer (for yourself!)

So, given all of my hot takes... For ambitious young innovators, perhaps the more relevant and crucial question to ask is: 

**What do we do?**  

Do we get an PhD (or go to grad school in general), or do we jump into working at a company?

If you ask me, the answer depends on the returns you believe a graduate degree would get you.




### When to Choose Academia (MS, PhD):  
1. **If you want to pioneer fundamental science**  
   Fields like quantum computing, particle physics, or theoretical AI still require deep academic training. A PhD gives you access to cutting-edge labs (e.g., CERN, MIT Media Lab) and mentors who shape entire disciplines. A good example: CRISPR gene-editing breakthroughs emerged from decades of university research ([Doudna & Charpentier, 2014](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1258096)).  


2. **If Credentials matter**  
   If you're going into fields like biotech or academia, where there is a high demand for PhDs in leadership roles. Get your PhD. Moderna’s mRNA team, for instance, was stacked with PhDs who turned academic insights into a vaccine ([Moderna, 2020](https://modernatx.com)). 


3. **If you enjoy unstructured exploration (or have a track record of thriving in an academic environment)**  
   PhDs allow you to dive into niche problems without the pressure of quarterly profits. A good example would be the DARPA-funded university project ([Leiner et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1145/1629607.1629613)). You get more freedom to define your research and carry it out at your own pace. Obviously, at a rate that your mentor allows.


### When to Choose Industry:  
1. **If you want to solve problems *now***  
   Time doesn't wait. Big things are happening all the time in industry. SpaceX engineers iterated reusable rockets in years, not decades ([Berger, 2020](https://www.amazon.com/Liftoff-Elon-Musk-Desperate-Launched/dp/0062979973)). If you want to contribute **now**, go into industry.

2. **If Execution > theory**  
   If you value execution more than theory in your daily work, choose industry. A good proof/piece of evidence for this is how OpenAI’s GPT-4 required trial-and-error engineers ([OpenAI, 2023](https://openai.com)). Companies need to get things running ASAP.


3. **If you're interested in Entrepreneurship**  
   Founders like Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum) prove credentials aren’t everything.  Experience matters as an entrepreneur. Obviously, I put this as a third condition for a reason. Tons of PhDs became successful entrepreneurs, but of course, at the time cost of 5-6 years, whereas you can use the time to jump into industry. Your call.


Finally, things are constantly changing. Live your life to the fullest, and don't forget to **stay upwind** when making a career choice. Best of Luck.
