title: The Future of Innovation & The End of Academic Monopoly
---

In today’s landscape, companies—not universities—are becoming the core engines of innovation.

# The Internet Has Democratized Knowledge 

Let's face it: **the rise of the internet has completely democratized access to knowledge.**

Academia’s monopoly on expertise is no longer as effective. Information is cheap and everywhere. Anyone with drive and curiosity can learn anything online. A 2023 report from the National Student Clearinghouse found that computer science and engineering enrollments in U.S. universities have plateaued, while coding bootcamps and industry certifications (e.g., Google or AWS) have seen explosive growth ([National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, 2023](https://nscresearchcenter.org)). This suggests that many aspiring technologists are bypassing universities altogether.  

If you’re a self-directed learner, the internet can turn you into an expert in almost any field. That means when it comes to theoretical knowledge, academia doesn't hold the same edge they once did. 

This isn’t to discredit the work of academics or higher education institutions.After all, universities still produce groundbreaking research, create an environment for deep intellectual collaboration, and provide structured learning and mentorship for those who thrive in that environment. Universities remain vital for foundational science and critical thinking, but when it comes to moving ideas from the lab to the market, the private sector is pulling ahead...

# The Shift to Applied Innovation

Hot take #2: **We might be reaching the limits of traditional theoretical science.**

A 2021 analysis in *Nature* found that scientific papers and patents are becoming increasingly incremental rather than revolutionary ([Park et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06106-4)). The low-hanging fruit of 20th-century science (semiconductors, antibiotics, nuclear energy) has been picked, leaving harder, niche problems that require industry collaboration. 

There just aren’t many paradigm-shifting breakthroughs left that can radically transform manufacturing or other industries. The real innovation today is happening on the ground—solving hard, practical engineering problems. And that’s where startup teams and industry engineers, who are in the trenches, have a major advantage over academics. Companies like Apple, NVIDIA, and Moderna now invest more in R&D than many governments. In 2023, Amazon spent **$73 billion** on R&D—more than France’s entire public research budget ([Statista, 2023](https://statista.com); [OECD, 2023](https://oecd.org)). Many transformative technologies like OpenAI’s GPT models and Tesla’s autonomous driving systems were developed in industry. A 2022 Stanford study found that **80% of AI breakthroughs** originate in corporate labs ([Zhang et al., 2022](https://aiindex.stanford.edu)). Meanwhile, university research struggles with funding gaps and slow tech transfer processes ([Britt, 2023](https://sciencebusiness.net)).  
 
Especially in the U.S., under the current political climate, this might be more of a dire issue.

# VC Demands Execution. Not Just Ideas

The shift to applied innovation, coupled with tightening U.S. funding landscapes, explains why academic projects struggle to attract investment. 

A lot of seasoned VCs aren’t even touching angel or Series A rounds anymore. The bar is higher. Founders are expected to get scrappy, find early traction, and get through the A round before serious capital even considers coming in. Investors want to see a clearer picture before they write a check. Data from PitchBook (2024) shows that seed-stage funding has grown, but Series A rounds have become far more selective ([PitchBook-NVCA Venture Monitor, 2024](https://pitchbook.com)).   Investors now expect startups to demonstrate revenue, customer adoption, or a clear path to monetization before committing. 

An idea or a patent will no longer be sufficient as the driving force behind a successful startup.

# A Qustion Only You Can Answer (for yourself!)

So, given all of my hot takes... For ambitious young innovators, the critical question is: 

**What do we do?**  

Do we get an PhD, or do we jump into a company?

If you ask me, the answer is that, depends on the returns you believe a PhD would get you.




### When to Choose Academia (PhD):  
1. **If you want to pioneer fundamental science**  
   FFields like quantum computing, particle physics, or theoretical AI still require deep academic training. A PhD gives you access to cutting-edge labs (e.g., CERN, MIT Media Lab) and mentors who shape entire disciplines. A good example: CRISPR gene-editing breakthroughs emerged from decades of university research ([Doudna & Charpentier, 2014](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1258096)).  


2. **If Credentials matter**  
   If you're going into fields like biotech or academia, where there is a high demand for PhDs in leadership roles. Go get you PhD. Moderna’s mRNA team, for instance, was stacked with PhDs who turned academic insights into a vaccine ([Moderna, 2020](https://modernatx.com)). 


3. **If you enjoy unstructured exploration (or have a track record of thriving in an academic environment)**  
   PhDs allow you to dive into niche problems without the pressure of quarterly profits. A good example would be the DARPA-funded university project ([Leiner et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1145/1629607.1629613)). You get somewhat more freedom to define your research, and carry it out at your own pace. Obviously, at a rate that your mentor allows.


### When to Choose Industry:  
1. **If you want to solve problems *now***  
   Time doesn't wait. Big things are happening all the time in industry. SpaceX engineers iterated reusable rockets in years, not decades ([Berger, 2020](https://www.amazon.com/Liftoff-Elon-Musk-Desperate-Launched/dp/0062979973)). If you want to contribute **now**, go into industry bestie.

2. **If Execution > theory**  
   If you value execution more than theory in your daily work, choose industry. A good proof/piece of evidence for this is how OpenAI’s GPT-4 required trial-and-error engineers ([OpenAI, 2023](https://openai.com)). Companies need to get things running ASAP.


3. **If you're interested in Entrepreneurship**  
   Founders like Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum) prove credentials aren’t everything.  Experience matters as an entrepeneur. Obviously I put this as a third condition for a reason. There's tons of PhDs who became successful entrepeneurs, but of course at the time cost of 5-6 years, whereas you can use the time to jump into industry. Your call.


Finally, things are constantly changing. Live your life to the fullest, and dont forget to **stay upwind** when making a career choice. Best of Luck.
