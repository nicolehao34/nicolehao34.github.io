title: The Future of Innovation
---

In today’s landscape, companies—not universities—are becoming the core engines of innovation.

First, the rise of the internet has completely democratized access to knowledge. Information is cheap and everywhere. Anyone with drive and curiosity can learn anything online. As Elon Musk pointed out, if you’re a self-directed learner, the internet can turn you into an expert in almost any field. That means when it comes to theoretical knowledge, professors don’t hold the same edge they once did.

Second, we’re reaching the limits of traditional theoretical science—there just aren’t many paradigm-shifting breakthroughs left that can radically transform manufacturing or other industries. The real innovation today is happening on the ground—solving hard, practical engineering problems. And that’s where startup teams and industry engineers, who are in the trenches, have a major advantage over academics. Professors might have ideas, but operators know how to execute.

That’s also why most academic projects just don’t have real investment potential. A lot of seasoned VCs aren’t even touching angel or Series A rounds anymore. The bar is higher. Founders are expected to get scrappy, find early traction, and get through the A round before serious capital even considers coming in. Investors want to see a clearer picture before they write a check.
