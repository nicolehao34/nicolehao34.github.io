Hot take: In today’s landscape, companies—not universities—are becoming the core engines of innovation.

# The Internet Has Democratized Knowledge 

Let's face it: the rise of the internet has completely democratized access to knowledge. Academia’s monopoly on expertise is no longer as effective. Information is cheap and everywhere. Anyone with drive and curiosity can learn anything online. A 2023 report from the National Student Clearinghouse found that computer science and engineering enrollments in U.S. universities have plateaued, while coding bootcamps and industry certifications (like Google’s or AWS’s) have seen explosive growth. This suggests that many aspiring technologists are bypassing universities altogether.

If you’re a self-directed learner, the internet can turn you into an expert in almost any field. That means when it comes to theoretical knowledge, academia doesn't hold the same edge they once did. 

This isn’t to discredit the work of academics or higher education institutions.After all, universities still produce groundbreaking research, create an environment for deep intellectual collaboration, and provide structured learning and mentorship for those who thrive in that environment. Universities remain vital for foundational science and critical thinking, but when it comes to moving ideas from the lab to the market, the private sector is pulling ahead...

# The Shift to Applied Innovation
We might be reaching the limits of traditional theoretical science. 

A 2021 analysis in Nature found that scientific papers and patents are becoming increasingly incremental rather than revolutionary ("The slowing rate of scientific breakthroughs", Nature 2021). The low-hanging fruit of 20th-century science (semiconductors, antibiotics, nuclear energy) has been picked, leaving harder, more niche problems that require deep industry collaboration.

There just aren’t many paradigm-shifting breakthroughs left that can radically transform manufacturing or other industries. The real innovation today is happening on the ground—solving hard, practical engineering problems. And that’s where startup teams and industry engineers, who are in the trenches, have a major advantage over academics. Companies like Apple, NVIDIA, and Moderna now invest more in R&D than many governments. In 2023, Amazon spent $73 billion on R&D, that is more than the entire research budget of France. Many of the most transformative technologies of the past decade, from OpenAI’s GPT models to Tesla’s autonomous driving—were developed in industry, not academia. A 2022 Stanford study found that over 80% of AI breakthroughs now come from corporate labs, not universities.  Meanwhile, university research often struggles with funding gaps and slow tech transfer processes. Especially in the U.S., under the current political climate, this might be more of a dire issue.


# VC Demands Execution. Not Just Ideas

This shift to applied innoation, coupled with the funding circumstances in the U.S., also contribute to why most academic projects struggle with finding real investment potential. 

A lot of seasoned VCs aren’t even touching angel or Series A rounds anymore. The bar is higher. Founders are expected to get scrappy, find early traction, and get through the A round before serious capital even considers coming in. Investors want to see a clearer picture before they write a check. Data from PitchBook (2024) shows that seed-stage funding has grown, but Series A rounds have become far more selective. Investors now expect startups to demonstrate revenue, customer adoption, or a clear path to monetization before committing.


# Some Final Words

Given my hot takes, what I really want to say is that, this brings in the question for many young people with an ambition to innovate. 

What do we do?

Do we get an PhD, or do we jump into a company. 

If you ask me, the answer is that, depends on the returns you believe a PhD would get you.

When to Choose Academia (PhD):

1. If you want to pioneer fundamental science. Fields like quantum computing, particle physics, or theoretical AI still require deep academic training. A PhD gives you access to cutting-edge labs (e.g., CERN, MIT Media Lab) and mentors who shape entire disciplines. Some good examples would be, CRISPR gene-editing breakthroughs emerged from decades of university research.

2. If credentials matter for your industry. Biotech, pharmaceuticals, and academia itself often demand PhDs for leadership roles. Moderna’s mRNA team, for instance, was stacked with PhDs who turned academic insights into a vaccine.

3. If you thrive in unstructured, long-term exploration. OR, you have a track record of loving research in an academic environment. PhDs allow you to dive into niche problems without the pressure of quarterly profits. This freedom birthed innovations like the internet (born from DARPA-funded university projects).



When to Choose Industry:
1. If you want to solve problems **now**

Companies move faster. Self-taught engineers at SpaceX, for example, iterated on reusable rockets in years, not decades. The internet has made expertise accessible—why wait?

2. If your field rewards execution over theory

Software engineering, fintech, and consumer tech prioritize shipping products. OpenAI’s GPT-4 wasn’t built by PhDs alone; it required engineers who learned through trial and error.

3. If you’re entrepreneurial

Founders like Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum, college dropout) or Steve Jobs prove that industry experience often trumps credentials. Investors fund traction, not dissertations.
