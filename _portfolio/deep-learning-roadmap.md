## Overview

An interactive roadmap visualizing all key concepts in deep learning, created as a comprehensive learning resource. The project aims to transform a detailed concept map into an interactive web-based tool. I created the following chart after learning about deep learning in college, and decided to turn it into an interactive, educational roadmap that I can use in my tutoring sessions.

## Project Goals

* Create a visual learning path through deep learning fundamentals
* Provide structured progression through concepts
* Make complex topics accessible through interactive visualization
* Build a web-based alternative to static concept maps


## Current Features

* Comprehensive concept map covering college-level deep learning curriculum
* Organized hierarchy of topics from fundamentals to advanced concepts
* Links to external resources and explanations

## Technical Stack

* **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
* **Visualization**: React Flow
* **Animation**: Manim (for concept explanations)
* **Build Tool**: Vite

## Concept Coverage

The roadmap includes:

* Neural network fundamentals
* Optimization algorithms
* Activation functions
* Regularization techniques
* CNN architectures
* RNN and sequence models
* Attention mechanisms
* Transformer architectures
* Generative models
* Advanced topics in modern deep learning

## Development Roadmap

**Phase 1** (Complete):
* Created comprehensive concept map
* Identified all key relationships between topics

**Phase 2** (In Progress):
* Converting to interactive web format
* Adding React Flow visualization
* Implementing navigation and search

**Phase 3** (Planned):
* Adding interactive examples
* Integrating Manim animations
* Building tutorial content for each node
