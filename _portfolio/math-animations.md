## Overview

A collection of mathematical animations created using Manim (Mathematical Animation Engine) to explain complex mathematical concepts through visual storytelling.

## Project Goals

* Make abstract mathematical concepts more intuitive through visualization
* Create educational content for students learning advanced mathematics
* Demonstrate the power of visual explanations in mathematical education
* Build a library of reusable mathematical visualizations

## Technical Stack

* **Manim**: Mathematical animation engine (developed by 3Blue1Brown)
* **Python**: Primary programming language
* **LaTeX**: Mathematical typesetting integration

## Current Content

### Chess Mathematics

Detailed animations explaining mathematical concepts in chess:
* Game theory principles
* Probabilistic analysis
* Optimal strategy computation
* Position evaluation algorithms

## Animation Categories (Planned)

1. **Linear Algebra**
   - Matrix transformations
   - Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
   - Vector spaces

2. **Calculus**
   - Derivatives and limits
   - Integration techniques
   - Multivariable calculus

3. **Differential Equations**
   - Phase portraits
   - Solution curves
   - Stability analysis

4. **Probability & Statistics**
   - Probability distributions
   - Central limit theorem
   - Statistical inference

5. **Abstract Algebra**
   - Group theory
   - Ring and field properties
   - Symmetry concepts

## Development Approach

* Focus on intuition before formalism
* Build from simple to complex examples
* Emphasize visual patterns and relationships
* Include interactive elements where possible

## Inspiration

Inspired by educational content creators like:
* 3Blue1Brown (Grant Sanderson)
* Mathologer
* Numberphile
