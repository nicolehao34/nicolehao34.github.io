I'm Nicole Hao, a Master of Engineering student in Computer Science at Cornell University, passionate about AI and human-centered technology. My work focuses on developing tools that leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), deep learning, and multimodal systems to address real-world challenges in enterprise scalability, education, and healthcare.

Fun fact: I'm a practicing Buddhist. I go on mediation retreats. Don't get me started on Buddhism (and my screen time).

Previously, I built:
-  **InkSight**: An AI-powered STEM note-taking and accessibility platform for students with learning disorders and auditory + visual impairments.
- **RAG Exam Review Bot**: A transformer-based exam prep assistant that retrieves and summarizes lecture content from PDFs and course websites.  
  [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/nicolehao34/ai-pdf-chatbot)
- **Classifying Solar Flares Using Supervised ML**:  
  Developed a machine learning pipeline to classify solar flares using real-world data. Improved prediction accuracy for solar flare events. Research results published in the Astrophysical Journal.

- **Minimization of Differential Lateral Acceleration for Starshade Stationkeeping**:  
  Developed algorithms to minimize lateral acceleration differences in spacecraft stationkeeping for starshade missions, improving alignment precision for exoplanet imaging.
