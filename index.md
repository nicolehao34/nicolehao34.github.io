I’m Nicole Hao, a Master of Engineering student at Cornell University passionate about AI, accessibility, and human-centered technology. My work focuses on building tools that empower neurodiverse students, and applying deep learning and multimodal systems to real-world challenges in education, insurance, and healthcare.

Previously, I built:
-  **InkSight**: An AI-powered STEM note-taking and accessibility platform for students with learning disorders and auditory + visual impairments.
- **RAG Exam Review Bot**: A transformer-based exam prep assistant that retrieves and summarizes lecture content from PDFs and course websites.  
  [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/nicolehao34/ai-pdf-chatbot)
-  **AI Underwriting Triage**: A DistilBERT-based system for evaluating insurance broker submissions at Ascot.
- **Classifying Solar Flares Using Supervised ML**:  
  Developed a machine learning pipeline to classify solar flares using real-world data. Improved prediction accuracy for solar flare events. Research results published in the Astrophysical Journal.

- **Minimization of Differential Lateral Acceleration for Starshade Stationkeeping**:  
  Developed algorithms to minimize lateral acceleration differences in spacecraft stationkeeping for starshade missions, improving alignment precision for exoplanet imaging.
