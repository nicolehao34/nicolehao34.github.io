I'm Nicole Hao, a Master of Engineering student in Computer Science at Cornell University, passionate about AI and human-centered technology.


 My work focuses on developing tools that leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), deep learning, and multimodal systems to address real-world challenges in enterprise scalability, education, and healthcare.



Fun fact: I'm a practicing Buddhist. I go on mediation retreats. Don't get me started on Buddhism (and my screen time).


# Projects
Previously, I built:



-  **InkSight** <br>
An AI-powered STEM note-taking and accessibility platform for students with learning disorders and auditory + visual impairments. Demo coming soon.



- **[RAG Exam Review Bot](https://github.com/nicolehao34/ai-pdf-chatbot)** <br>
A transformer-based exam prep assistant that retrieves and summarizes lecture content from PDFs and course websites.  



- **[Classifying Solar Flares Using Supervised ML](https://github.com/nicolehao34/solar_flares_classification)** <br>
  Developed a machine learning pipeline to classify solar flares using real-world data. Improved prediction accuracy for solar flare events. Research results published in the Astrophysical Journal.



- **[Minimization of Differential Lateral Acceleration for Starshade Stationkeeping](https://github.com/nicolehao34/starshade_stationkeeping)** <br>
  Developed algorithms to minimize lateral acceleration differences in spacecraft stationkeeping for starshade missions, improving alignment precision for exoplanet imaging.
