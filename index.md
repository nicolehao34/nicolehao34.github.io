I’m Nicole Hao, a Master of Engineering student at Cornell University passionate about AI, accessibility, and human-centered technology. My work focuses on building tools that empower neurodiverse students, and applying deep learning and multimodal systems to real-world challenges in education, insurance, and healthcare.

Previously, I built:
-  **InkSight**: An AI-powered note-taking and accessibility platform for students with ADHD and learning disorders.
- **RAG Review Agent**: A transformer-based exam prep assistant that retrieves and summarizes lecture content from PDFs.
-  **AI Underwriting Scorecard**: A DistilBERT-based system for evaluating insurance broker submissions at Ascot.

I’ve also worked with the Cornell AI Innovation Lab and built tools that help automate clinical reasoning and training in veterinary medicine.
