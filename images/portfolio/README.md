## Image Guidelines

- **Recommended size**: 1200x630 pixels (or similar aspect ratio)
- **Format**: PNG or JPG
- **Content suggestions**:
  - Screenshots of the project interface
  - Diagrams showing architecture
  - Results/visualizations from the project
  - Repository social preview images from GitHub

## How to Add Images

1. For each GitHub repository, you can use the repository's social preview:
   - Go to the repository on GitHub
   - Click Settings → Social preview
   - Upload an image or use the auto-generated one
   - Download and save it here

2. Or create custom images:
   - Take screenshots of your project
   - Create diagrams using tools like Figma, Canva, or PowerPoint
   - Use visualization outputs from your projects

3. Or use placeholder service temporarily:
   - Visit https://placeholder.com/
   - Generate 600x400 images with project names

## Fallback Behavior

If no image is found, the portfolio page will display:
- A gradient background with the first letter of the project title
- This provides a clean fallback while you add custom images

## Adding Your Images

Simply save your images to this directory with the filenames listed above, and they will automatically appear on your portfolio page!
